# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict car prices using machine learning regression
techniques based on various car features.

## Dataset
The dataset contains car-related attributes such as:
- Mileage
- Engine power
- Brand information
- Other relevant features affecting price

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Methodology
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature selection and transformation
- Training a regression model
- Evaluating model performance

## Results
The trained regression model predicts car prices with reasonable accuracy,
showing how machine learning can assist in price estimation.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a real-world application of machine learning in
predicting car prices, which can be useful for buyers, sellers, and businesses.
